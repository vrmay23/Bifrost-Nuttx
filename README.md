# Bifrost Setup Script

This repository contains a full automation script for setting up and building [Apache NuttX RTOS](https://nuttx.apache.org/) on the following targets:

- **ESP32-C3** (RISC-V)
- **Raspberry Pi Pico** (RP2040)
- **NuttX Simulator** (for PC testing)

It also automates installation and configuration of essential tools, toolchains, and environments.

## üîß What the script does

This script handles all steps required to build and run NuttX from scratch, including:

- Installing all required Linux packages and development dependencies
- Creating the `~/embedded_sys` workspace folder structure
- Cloning the official NuttX kernel, apps, and tools repositories
- Setting up the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
- Downloading and configuring the RISC-V toolchain for ESP32-C3
- Downloading ESP32-C3 bootloader and partition binaries
- Setting up and activating a Python virtual environment for ESP32-C3
- Installing and building OpenOCD with ST-Link support
- Building and running NuttX for all three targets
- Flashing firmware to Raspberry Pi Pico and ESP32-C3
